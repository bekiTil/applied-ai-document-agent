## Executive Summary  

| Item | Key Point | Evidence |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Pilot Scope** | AI‑assisted ticket triage for low‑complexity tickets (onboarding, billing, feature‑usability) | *customer_support_analysis.txt* – “automated responses for low‑complexity tickets.” |
| **Architecture** | Asynchronous, API‑driven micro‑service that never blocks core production traffic | *engineering_constraints.txt* – “AI‑powered internal tools are acceptable only if they operate asynchronously.” |
| **Validation** | Mandatory human‑in‑the‑loop review and rollback for every AI output | *ai_initiative_proposal.txt* – “Validation processes must be established to verify AI outputs before deployment.” |

| **Timeline** | Capacity analysis (Weeks 0‑2) → Pilot launch (Weeks 3‑4) → First performance review (Week 8) | Consistent with *engineering_constraints.txt* (capacity analysis before deployment) |
| **Next Steps** | Approve budget, assemble cross‑functional team, and commence capacity analysis | |

## Detailed Risk Assessment  

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|--------|------------|------------|-------------|
| **Hallucination / Incorrect Output** | High (customer confusion, SLA breach) | Medium | Validation workflow, human review, rollback threshold | Pause pilot if error > 10 % |
| **SLA Degradation** | High (customer churn, revenue loss) | Low | Capacity analysis, async design, traffic staging | Rollback to 100 % manual triage |
| **Infrastructure Overload** | Medium (latency spikes, outages) | Medium | Load simulation, autoscaling limits, monitoring alerts | Scale resources or throttle AI service |
| **Cost Overrun** | Medium (budget breach) | Low | Strict budget tracking, cost‑of‑compute monitoring | Re‑evaluate pilot scope |
| **Compliance / Data Privacy** | Medium (regulatory fines) | Low | Data‑at‑rest encryption, tokenization of PII, audit logs | Halt data ingestion if non‑compliant |
| **User Acceptance** | Low (agents distrust AI) | Medium | Comprehensive training, transparent error handling | Provide manual overrides and clear escalation paths |
| **Model Drift** | Medium (accuracy decline) | Medium | Monthly retraining, continuous evaluation | Stop inference until model retrained |

## Conclusion

The revised proposal establishes a **low‑risk, data‑driven pilot** of AI‑assisted ticket triage that aligns with the organization’s Q4 cost‑cutting objectives while strictly adhering to infrastructure and reliability constraints. By embedding **asynchronous design**, **human validation**, and **robust monitoring**, we mitigate the primary risks of hallucination, SLA impact, and system overload. The pilot will deliver tangible metrics—accuracy, resolution time, CSAT, and infrastructure savings—enabling an evidence‑based decision on whether to scale the initiative.  

**Call to Action**  
- Approve the pilot budget and scope.  
- Assign a cross‑functional pilot steering committee (Support, Engineering, Compliance, Finance).  
- Initiate capacity analysis immediately (Week 0).  
- Schedule the first performance review for Week 8, with the intention to adjust scope or rollback if metrics fall below thresholds.
