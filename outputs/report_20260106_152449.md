## Decision‑Ready Report  
*(Prepared for the Executive Team – Q4 2026)*  

---  

### Executive Summary  
- **AI pilot recommended** – start with ticket triage & report drafting, not full rollout.  
- **Clear success metrics required** – resolution time, risk‑detection accuracy, churn impact.  
- **Validation framework needed** – monitor hallucinations, error rates, and SLA compliance.  
- **Engineering constraints dictate design** – asynchronous, API‑based, minimal core impact, gradual rollout with rollback.  
- **Alignment with Q4 strategy** – AI should support churn reduction, onboarding, and premium adoption while keeping costs in check.  
- **Feasibility study mandatory** – evaluate data, cost, training, and agent workflow changes before investment.  
- **Stakeholder communication plan** – regular updates on metrics, risks, and adjustment plans.  
- **Documentation audit** – improve clarity of onboarding & billing docs to boost AI accuracy.

### Themes  

| Theme | Key Points |
|-------|------------|
| **AI‑Enabled Efficiency** | AI summarization, priority detection, draft reporting to reduce manual effort. |
| **Quality & Reliability** | Concerns about hallucinations and output reliability; need validation. |
| **Pilot & Evaluation** | Limited pilot, clear success metrics, phased rollout. |
| **Engineering Constraints** | Must be async, API‑based, avoid core production impact; limited bandwidth. |
| **Q4 Revenue & Cost Strategy** | Focus on churn reduction, onboarding, premium use, 10% infra cost cut, 15% marketing cut. |
| **Customer Sentiment & Support Load** | 22 % ticket rise, declining satisfaction, key pain points in documentation & response time. |

### Conflicts / Disagreements  
| Issue | Perspective | Evidence | Potential Resolution |
|-------|-------------|----------|----------------------|
| **AI Reliability vs. Quick Deployment** | Stakeholders worry about hallucinations; leadership wants productivity gains. | *“Stakeholder concerns: reliability of AI outputs and hallucinated information.”* | Pilot with strict validation and rollback. |
| **Engineering Bandwidth vs. AI Development** | Existing constraints limit large refactors; AI tools must not add load. | *“Engineering bandwidth is constrained, uptime must stay above a 99.95 % SLA.”* | Design AI as an asynchronous micro‑service with minimal API footprint. |
| **Cost vs. Value** | Q4 calls for cost cuts while AI could add expense. | *“Engineering must cut infrastructure costs by at least 10% without compromising reliability.”* | Demonstrate AI’s ROI via pilot metrics before full scale. |

### Recommendations (Ranked by Priority)

1. **Launch a Limited AI Pilot (Support & Reporting)**  
   - *Define specific success metrics* (ticket resolution time, risk‑detection accuracy, churn reduction).  
   - *Build an asynchronous, API‑driven micro‑service* per engineering constraints.  
   - *Pilot scope*: 10–15% of support tickets and one reporting team.  
   > *Evidence:* “The plan calls for a limited pilot, with expansion contingent on meeting clear success metrics.”  

2. **Establish a Validation & Monitoring Framework**  
   - *Track hallucinations*, error rates, SLA impact, and agent escalation rates.  
   - *Rollback procedures* in place for any negative impact.  
   > *Evidence:* “Requirement for clear evaluation and validation mechanisms to address quality issues.”  

3. **Conduct a Feasibility & Cost‑Benefit Study**  
   - Evaluate data needs, training resources, integration effort, and ROI.  
   - Include a documentation audit to improve AI training data.  
   > *Evidence:* “No assessment of how the solution will affect agent workload distribution.”  

4. **Integrate AI Pilot with Q4 Customer‑Success Initiatives**  
   - Align pilot KPIs with churn, onboarding completion, and premium feature adoption.  
   - Use AI‑generated insights to target high‑risk accounts.  
   > *Evidence:* “Priority detection to flag high‑risk customer accounts.”  

5. **Maintain Engineering Discipline**  
   - Ensure the AI tool does **not** touch core production pipelines.  
   - Adopt a gradual rollout with monitoring checkpoints.  
   > *Evidence:* “New systems must integrate via existing APIs…must avoid long‑running synchronous processes.”  

6. **Set a Monitoring Cadence for Stakeholders**  
   - Quarterly updates on metrics, risk mitigations, and budget impact.  
   > *Evidence:* “Leadership Communication: Provide regular updates to stakeholders on progress against these priorities.”  

7. **Plan for Scale Only After Pilot Success**  
   - Expand to full support coverage and additional internal teams (e.g., reporting).  
   - Re‑evaluate resource allocation against Q4 cost‑cut targets.  
   > *Evidence:* “Expansion planned only after clear success metrics are met.”

**Next Steps for the Manager**  
- Approve pilot budget and resource allocation.  
- Authorize the feasibility study and documentation audit.  
- Set up a cross‑functional steering committee (Engineering, Support, Product, Finance).  
- Schedule a kickoff meeting for the pilot launch in the first quarter of Q4.
