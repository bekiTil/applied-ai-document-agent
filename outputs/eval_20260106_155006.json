    "Some sections (Themes and Conflicts/Disagreements) overlap in content and could be merged to improve conciseness.",
    "The report lacks specific budget figures or a cost\u2013benefit analysis to support the Call to Action.",
    "While the Recommendations are ranked, the action steps sometimes rely on generic tools (e.g., \u201ccustom UI in ServiceNow\u201d) without specifying implementation details."
  ],
  "improvements": [
    "Consolidate overlapping sections to streamline the document and reduce repetition.",
    "Insert a concise budget table with projected costs, savings, and ROI metrics to justify the pilot investment.",
    "Add concrete implementation details for tools and processes (e.g., specify the ServiceNow integration workflow, define API contract specs, and detail monitoring alert thresholds)."
