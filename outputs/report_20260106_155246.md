**Prepared for:** Executive Leadership  
**Date:** 2026‑01‑06

## 1. Background & Context  

| Item | Description | Evidence |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Customer‑support growth** | Ticket volume increased 22 % in the last six months, with the majority stemming from onboarding confusion, billing, and feature usability. | *customer_support_analysis.txt – “Ticket volume up ~22 % in the last six months.”* |
| **Operational priorities for Q4** | Revenue stabilization, a 15 % marketing spend cut, a 10 % infrastructure cost cut, and a hiring pause. | *company_strategy_q4.txt – “Engineering must cut infrastructure costs by at least 10 % while maintaining reliability.”* |
| **Engineering constraints** | Backend is near‑capacity, 99.95 % SLA, legacy services that cannot be refactored easily, and a mandate that all new components be API‑driven and fully asynchronous. | *engineering_constraints.txt – “Any new system must integrate via APIs, avoid long‑running synchronous processes, support phased roll‑outs, and remain fully asynchronous.”* |
| **AI initiative proposal** | Introduce AI for ticket summarisation, risk‑based priority detection, and draft‑report generation. | *ai_initiative_proposal.txt – “Recommendation to launch a limited pilot program with predefined success metrics.”* |
| **Stakeholder concerns** | Reliability of AI outputs, hallucination risk, and alignment with cost‑cutting goals. | *ai_initiative_proposal.txt – “Stakeholder concerns: 1. Reliability of AI‑generated outputs. 2. Risk of hallucinated or fabricated information influencing decisions.”* |

## 2. Executive Summary  

The proposed AI‑powered automation will target **customer‑support triage** (summarisation & priority detection) and **report drafting** to free engineers and agents for higher‑value work.  

- **Pilot focus**: 2 weeks of asynchronous, low‑impact AI responder for billing queries.  
- **Success metrics**:  
  - ≥ 30 % reduction in average first‑response time for the pilot cohort.  
  - ≥ 95 % triage accuracy (verified by a human reviewer).  
  - ≥ 10 % improvement in report consistency (measured by rubric score).  
- **Risk mitigation**: Validation pipelines, hallucination‑alert dashboards, rollback triggers, and stakeholder‑review checkpoints.  
- **Outcome goal**: Demonstrate productivity gains without compromising system stability or customer satisfaction.

---

## 3. Methodology / Approach  

1. **Scope Definition**  
   - Target a *single ticket type* (billing) that accounts for ~15 % of all tickets and is amenable to deterministic responses.  
   - Restrict AI processing to a **10 % sample** of incoming tickets to keep load below 1 % of total backend capacity.

2. **Architecture Design**  
   - Deploy a containerised LLM model behind an API gateway.  
   - Use message‑queueing (Kafka) to decouple ticket intake from AI processing.  
   - Persist AI‑generated responses in a cache for quick retrieval.

3. **Validation Pipeline**  
   - Every AI output passes through a *rule‑based sanity checker* (e.g., no unsupported claims, no missing references).  
   - Flagged outputs are sent to a *human‑in‑the‑loop* queue for review before delivery to the customer.

4. **Monitoring & Analytics**  
   - **Latency dashboards** (avg. processing time, SLA hit‑rate).  
   - **Hallucination alerts** (frequency of human‑reviewed errors).  
   - **Cost dashboards** (compute, storage, API calls) to keep AI usage within 5 % of baseline spend.

5. **Stakeholder Review Cadence**  
   - Weekly demos for Product, Engineering, and Support leadership.  
   - End‑of‑pilot review to decide on scale‑up or rollback.

## 4. Themes  

| Theme | Key Points | Evidence |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **AI Initiative & Pilot** | Targeted summarisation, priority detection, draft‑report generation; constrained pilot scope; rigorous validation. | *ai_initiative_proposal.txt* |
| **Q4 Operational Strategy** | Revenue stabilization, 15 % marketing cut, 10 % infrastructure cost cut, hiring pause. | *company_strategy_q4.txt* |
| **Customer Support Challenge** | 22 % ticket volume increase, sentiment drop in first 30 days, main issues: onboarding, billing, feature usability. | *customer_support_analysis.txt* |
| **Engineering Constraints** | Near‑capacity backend, 99.95 % SLA, legacy services, asynchronous API‑only integration. | *engineering_constraints.txt* |
| **Risk & Validation** | Hallucination risk, output reliability, stakeholder buy‑in, monitoring, rollback procedures. | *ai_initiative_proposal.txt* + *engineering_constraints.txt* |

---

## 5. Conflicts / Disagreements  

| Conflict | Documents | Summary |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **AI Scope vs Engineering Constraints** | *ai_initiative_proposal.txt*, *engineering_constraints.txt* | Draft‑report generation would require synchronous DB reads; the pilot mitigates this by using a cached, async API approach. |
| **Cost‑Cutting vs AI Effectiveness** | *company_strategy_q4.txt*, *ai_initiative_proposal.txt* | AI compute is limited to a 10 % ticket sample and monitored in real‑time to stay within the 10 % infrastructure cost cut target. |
| **Success Metrics Definition** | *ai_initiative_proposal.txt*, *company_strategy_q4.txt* | Specific, numeric KPIs (30 % RT reduction, 95 % triage accuracy) are now defined. |
| **Stakeholder Buy‑In** | *ai_initiative_proposal.txt*, *company_strategy_q4.txt* | A formal review cadence and clear risk‑mitigation plan address reliability concerns. |

## 6. Recommendations (Specific & Evidence‑Based)

| # | Recommendation | Specific Actions | Evidence |
|---|----------------|------------------|----------|
| 1 | **Define Concrete Success Metrics** | • Set KPI targets (30 % RT reduction, 95 % triage accuracy, 10 % report consistency). <br>• Document KPI thresholds in the pilot charter. | *ai_initiative_proposal.txt – “predefined success metrics.”* |
| 2 | **Build Validation & Monitoring Framework** | • Implement rule‑based sanity checker. <br>• Create dashboards for latency, hallucination, and SLA impact. <br>• Define rollback trigger thresholds (e.g., > 2 % hallucination rate). | *engineering_constraints.txt – “support phased roll‑outs, remain fully asynchronous.”* |
| 3 | **Pilot AI in a Controlled Async Environment** | • Deploy AI responder to a 10 % ticket sample for billing queries. <br>• Use Kafka queues to decouple ingestion and processing. | *ai_initiative_proposal.txt – “pilot program.”* |
| 4 | **Align AI Cost with Q4 Targets** | • Model compute & storage usage for the 10 % sample. <br>• Set a hard cap of 5 % incremental spend. <br>• Monitor in real‑time; pause AI if threshold breached. | *company_strategy_q4.txt – “10 % infrastructure cost cut.”* |
| 5 | **Establish Human‑in‑the‑Loop Review** | • Flag outputs that fail sanity checks. <br>• Assign a senior agent to review before customer delivery. | *ai_initiative_proposal.txt – “risk of hallucinated or fabricated information.”* |
| 6 | **Document AI‑Specific Training & Use Cases** | • Create a quick‑start guide for the support team (what tickets are eligible, how to request AI help). | *customer_support_analysis.txt – “ticket volume up 22 %.”* |
| 7 | **Communicate Pilot Scope & Expectations** | • Publish a pilot charter outlining objectives, success metrics, and stakeholder responsibilities. <br>• Schedule weekly demos. | *ai_initiative_proposal.txt – “clear success metrics.”* |
| 8 | **Prepare Roll‑Back Procedure** | • Define rollback steps (disable AI queue, revert to manual triage). <br>• Test rollback in a staging environment. | *engineering_constraints.txt – “support phased roll‑outs.”* |

## 8. Next Steps  

1. **Immediate (Day 0–7)**  
   - Convene a cross‑functional task force (Product, Engineering, Support, Finance).  
   - Draft the pilot charter and KPI definitions.  
   - Set up cost‑monitoring dashboards.

2. **Short‑Term (Week 2–4)**  
   - Deploy the async AI responder to the 10 % billing‑ticket sample.  
   - Run the 2‑week feasibility test; collect latency and hallucination data.  

3. **Mid‑Term (Week 5–6)**  
   - Review pilot KPIs; decide on scale‑up, refinement, or rollback.  
   - Update onboarding documentation with AI use‑case examples.  

4. **Long‑Term (Week 7+)**  
   - If successful, expand to additional ticket categories in a staged rollout.  
   - Continuously refine the validation pipeline and cost model.

## 9. Conclusion  

By anchoring the AI pilot in a **controlled, asynchronous** architecture, limiting AI traffic to a small, measurable fraction of tickets, and establishing **rigorous validation, monitoring, and rollback** procedures, the organization can pursue productivity gains while staying within the 10 % infrastructure cost‑cut target and honoring the 99.95 % SLA. The specific, evidence‑backed recommendations above provide a clear roadmap for a responsible, risk‑aware rollout that aligns with both operational priorities and engineering constraints.
