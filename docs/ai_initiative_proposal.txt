Proposal: AI-Powered Internal Productivity Tools

This proposal outlines a plan to introduce AI-powered tools to assist internal teams.
The initial focus is on customer support and internal reporting.

Proposed capabilities:
- Automated summarization of support tickets and customer feedback
- Priority detection for high-risk customer accounts
- Drafting internal reports for leadership review

Expected benefits:
- Reduced manual effort for support agents
- Faster insight generation for managers
- Improved consistency in reporting

Concerns raised by stakeholders:
- Reliability of AI-generated outputs
- Risk of hallucinated or incorrect information
- Need for clear evaluation and validation mechanisms

The proposal recommends starting with a limited pilot program
and expanding only after clear success metrics are met.
