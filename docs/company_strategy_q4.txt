Company Strategy – Q4 Internal Memo

The company’s primary objective for Q4 is revenue stabilization while preparing for a larger expansion in Q2 next year.
Due to macroeconomic uncertainty, leadership has decided to pause aggressive hiring and instead focus on operational efficiency.

Key priorities include:
- Reducing customer churn in mid-market accounts
- Improving onboarding experience for new customers
- Increasing usage of premium features among existing customers

Engineering teams have been asked to reduce infrastructure costs by at least 10% without impacting reliability.
Marketing budgets have been reduced by 15%, with a stronger emphasis on organic growth and partnerships.

Risks:
- Customer dissatisfaction due to slower feature delivery
- Increased pressure on existing engineers
- Potential loss of competitive edge if innovation slows

Leadership believes that AI-driven automation could offset some of these risks by improving productivity across support and engineering.
