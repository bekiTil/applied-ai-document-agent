Customer Support Analysis – Last 6 Months

Support ticket volume increased by approximately 22% over the last six months.
The majority of tickets fall into three categories:
1. Onboarding confusion
2. Billing and subscription questions
3. Feature usability issues

Sentiment analysis of support conversations indicates a gradual decline in customer satisfaction,
especially among new customers in their first 30 days.

Common complaints include:
- Lack of clear documentation
- Delayed response times during peak hours
- Difficulty understanding advanced features

Positive feedback often mentions:
- Friendly support agents
- Fast resolution for simple issues
- Product reliability

Support leadership has proposed introducing AI-assisted ticket triage and automated responses
for low-complexity issues to reduce response time and free up human agents for complex cases.
