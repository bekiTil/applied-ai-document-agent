Engineering Constraints and System Limitations

The current backend infrastructure is stable but operating near peak capacity during high-traffic periods.
Recent load tests show that database read latency increases significantly under heavy analytical workloads.

Key constraints:
- Limited engineering bandwidth for large refactors
- Strict uptime requirements (99.95% SLA)
- Legacy services that are difficult to modify

Any new system introduced must:
- Integrate with existing services via APIs
- Avoid long-running synchronous processes
- Support gradual rollout and rollback

Engineering leadership is open to AI-powered internal tools,
as long as they operate asynchronously and do not impact core production systems.
